Every transaction is a collection of inputs and outputs. What makes Aeon private is that it is not known how the outputs are distributed; which are sent and which are returned as change. The supply is verifiable as is it always follows that `inputs == outputs + fee`. This chart represents the raw number count of inputs used in transactions over the course of a month.
